# Emission
The main codebase for the Emission project.

## Repository Etiquette:
1. Do not write to the master branch directly.
2. Create a pull request before merging with master.
3. Prune unecessary branches.
4. Try to Update the project board.
	
We can add things to this README as the project fleshes out.
