# Emission
The main codebase for the Emission project.

Repository Etiquette:
	*Do not write to the master branch directly.
	*Create a pull request before merging with master.
	*Prune unecessary branches.
	*Try to Update the project board.
	
We can add things to this README as the project fleshes out.
