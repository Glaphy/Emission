# Emission
Emission is a project which takes in user-defined geometries and charges and uses the Laplace Equation to plot potential and electric fields.

The GUI is written in Qt and the plots are generated through GNUplot. There are two methods to caluclate the fields, one is iterative and relies on FDTD methods and the other is a direct which method depends on sparse matrix computations performed by BLAS libraries.

## Build Instructions:
1. Do not write to the master branch directly.
2. Create a pull request before merging with master.
3. Prune unecessary branches.
4. Try to Update the project board.
5. Praise our lord and savior Lucifer.
	
We can add things to this README as the project fleshes out.
